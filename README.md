# Student Mental Health Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an interactive analytics dashboard built using Streamlit to explore
self-reported mental health and lifestyle indicators among students. The dashboard focuses on
population-level trends, correlations, and risk patterns rather than individual diagnosis.

## Problem Statement
Student mental health is influenced by multiple lifestyle and academic factors. However, these
patterns are often difficult to understand without structured analysis. This dashboard aims to
provide clear, data-driven insights into stress, anxiety, sleep, and related lifestyle behaviors.

## Dataset
- Synthetic, self-reported student mental health data
- ~300 students tracked over multiple weeks
- Variables include stress, anxiety, mood, sleep duration, screen time, study hours, and exercise

The dataset was generated programmatically to simulate realistic distributions and correlations.

## Key Features
- Interactive filters by course level (UG/PG) and gender
- Key performance indicators (average stress, sleep, anxiety, high-stress prevalence)
- Distribution analysis of stress and sleep patterns
- Relationship analysis between:
  - Sleep duration and stress levels
  - Screen time and anxiety levels

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

## Ethical Note
This project is intended strictly for educational and analytical purposes. It does not provide
medical diagnosis, mental health screening, or treatment recommendations.
